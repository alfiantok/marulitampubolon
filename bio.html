All good values and attitudes are rooted deep within the understanding of a Family and that is the derivative of who I really am. Persistently trying to simply be better than my previous imperfections and to set an exemplary attitudes and thus actions so it becomes positive habits which form an indomitable character that would eventually mold a prospective destiny. Being entrusted by GOD HIMSELF with a beautiful wife and a beautiful daughter is an incomparable blessing that is beautifully enigmatic. So, my gratefulness and thanksgiving to GOD are beyond unfathomable and indescribable. Therefore, it is an endless burning spirit possessed within me to seek the better me than my yesterday’s in a realistic setting to stay faithful in a life driven purpose; GOD given destiny.” - Maruli Tampubolon
